# Software Reengineering Course - Fork bc-xml-security  

The aim of this project is the analysis, reverse engineering and refactoring of an 
existing application.

The C# solution under consideration fits the basic project requirements:

* 19K lines of code (LOC) 
* open source, hosted on github with MIT License 
* not extremely complex (but further from trivial) 
* builds and runs without troubles 
* test cases and working examples 

The application is called [bc-xml-security](https://github.com/kmvi/bc-xml-security)
and is an implementation of some XML Security Standards using 
[Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/).
