The C$\#$ solution under consideration fits the basic project requirements:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item 19K lines of code (LOC) \\
    \item open source, hosted on github with MIT License \\
    \item not extremely complex (but further from trivial) \\
    \item builds and runs without troubles \\
    \item test cases and working examples \\
\end{itemize}
