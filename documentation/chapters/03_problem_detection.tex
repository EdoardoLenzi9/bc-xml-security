\chapter{Problem Detection}

\chapter{Code Smells}

The aim of this chapter is describing 

* Duplicated Code 
* Long Method 
* Large Class 
* Long Parameter List 
* Divergent Change 
* Shotgun Surgery 
* Feature Envy 
* ...

* Polymetric views

* Long methods (distribution view)
* System hotspots 
    * classes with too many responsabilities
    * classes too large
    * NOM Number of methods
    * NOA Number of attributes
    * LOC Lines of code

    * NMA wrt a child class, see the number of methods added 
    * NMO overridden 
    * NME extended

> inheritance classification view


# Detection strategy with metrics

* problem of magic tresholds


## GOD class 

Performs too much work on its own, 
u can smell it by metrics or blueprint

## Feature envy 

Denotes a method more interested in the data of 
a few other classes that of its own class.
(use blueprint)


## Data class

without logic, used by the others


## Brain Method

centralize the functionality of a class in the same way as a god class centralizes too much 
functionality of the system

# Version control history

VCS contains a lot of useful informations

* how often things change
* bug fixing
* code that changes in the past is likely to change in the future

Visualize class evolution (through the history -> animated diagram)


## Understand evolution, evolution smells

* [Code Maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat) (git analizer)
* Visualizing class evolution (base on NOM and NOA box diagram)
* Evolution matrix (don't scale, )


**Evolution patterns and smells**

* Day fly
* Pulsar/supernova
* White Dwarf/red giant/idle

* Extended polimetric views (kiviat diagram)

\chapter{OO Violations}

The aim of this chapter is to underline where the project violates 
some laws (LoD, DRY) and design principles (\textbf{S.O.L.I.D. Design Principle})
and the collaboration disarmonies.


\section{SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)}

Single purpose classes with a single reason to change

1. describe the primary responsibility in a sentence 
2. group similar methods
3. look at private/protected methods
4. decisions
5. internal relationship between methods and variables


\section{OCP (Open Closed Principle)}

Open for extension, closed for modifications, 
used for strategy patterns (different behaviours)

1. duplicated code, change history -> classes that frequently change together


\section{LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)}

SubTypes must be substitutable for their base type,
don't differentiate the base class from the derived class

1. subclass must accept everything the base class could accept
2. don't violate the post condition of the base class (design by contract)

> check contracts and remember that **each LSP violation is also an OCP 
violation but not vice versa**


\section{ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)}

Design cohesive interfaces, avoid fat interfaces 
(don't force clients to depend on methods that they never use)

Split fat interface per different clients (group methods);

1. check classes with an high number of public methods
    * check methods that frequently change together
2. group clients


\section{DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)}

High level modules should not depend on low level modules, both should 
depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details but vice versa.

Comes at the heart of framework design.

1. Use always interfaces, no variable should hold a reference to a concrete class.
2. No class should derive from a concrete class 

Someone soon or later must create a class instance but it mustn't be 
volatile-transient (singleton) 


\section{LoD (Law of Demeter)}

* Principle of Least Knowledge
* Only talk to immediate friends, don't talk with strangers
* Write shy code
* Minimize coupling

```
final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath(); 
a.getB().getC().doSomething() 
```
.*\(.*\).*\(.*\).*\(.*\)


\section{DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)}

Is a really nice rule cause improve maintainability and understandability
of the sys. 

> each piece of knowledge requires a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
within a system.

copy paste
redundan parameter


\section{Collaboration disarmonies}

* Intensive coupling 
(add a new method to the provider to replace multiple calls with a single call)

* Dispersed coupling (a brain method m)

* Shotgun surgery (data classes, brain methods, u have a method called by everyone)

* null 
* type checking
* pass an object
