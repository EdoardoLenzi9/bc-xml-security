# Setting Direction

Reengineering Life-Cycle:

* Model capture (main features, ui)
* Problem detection
* Requirement analysis
* Problem resolution

* Most valuable first 
    * customer values/business model
* keep it simple
* One hour overview
    * tests, abstract classes, comments, high fan-out classes
    * dependencies, version numbers
* Skim doc
* Demo and mock installation
* Refactor
* Test evolution

* project goals (measurable goals)
* cost estimation

* current state
* roadmap
* fix problems not symptoms

* where to start -> highmap

Project scope (description, context, goals, verification criteria)
Opportunities (what helps to achieve the project goals)
Risks (what can cause the main problems)
